        <p class="cpt">Git is a tool that helps you:</p>
        <li>save and manage different versions of your files and code.</li>
        <li>work with others, keep track of changes, and undo mistakes.</li>
        <li>these are just a few of the reasons...</li>

    <p>Git & GitHub
Git is a version control system that will help you keep track of the changes and history of your project throughout its lifestyle. I worked through two main components of version control throughout my project:
Branching - allows you to duplicate the source code for yourself. You will then work on your own branch so your edits do not immediately affect the original source code.
Merging - the process of joining your branch with the original source code after complete testing.
GitHub is the service that will host your Git repositories. Think of GitHub like the cloud server that hosts your source code. The repository for your project consists of all branches, commit, merge history, any licensing or readme files, rake/gem files, etc.
The partnership between Git and GitHub grant teams an invaluable asset - any and every modification to code is tracked through the two tools. Therefore, in the case of a mistake the code can efficiently and quickly be rolled back to its previous state prior to the error.
Workflow & Commonly Used Commands
Let's review a simple project workflow and the CLI commands that help us move from one step to the next. Below is a diagram of a workflow including Git & Github. This diagram most closely represents the flow of my group project.</p>
